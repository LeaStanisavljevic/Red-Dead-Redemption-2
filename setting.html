        <p>
            The world of Red Dead Redemption 2 spans five fictitious U.S. states. <br>
            The states of New Hanover, Ambarino and Lemoyne are new to the series, and are located <br>
            to the immediate north and east of Red Dead Redemption's world, whilst the states of New <br>
            Austin and West Elizabeth return from Red Dead Redemption. The states are centered on the <br>
            San Luis and Lannahechee Rivers and the shores of Flat Iron Lake. Ambarino is a mountain <br>
            wilderness, with the largest settlement being the Wapiti Native American reservation; <br>
            New Hanover encompasses a sweeping valley and woody foothills that feature the cattle town of Valentine, <br>
            the riverside Van Horn Trading Post, and the coal town of Annesburg; and Lemoyne is composed of bayous and <br>
            plantations resembling the southeastern United States, and is home to the Southern town of Rhodes, the <br>
            village of Lagras, and the former French colony of Saint Denis, analogous to New Orleans. <br>
            West Elizabeth consists of wide plains, dense forests, and the prosperous port town of Blackwater. <br>
            This region has been expanded from the original Red Dead Redemption with a vast northern portion containing <br>
            the mountain resort town of Strawberry. New Austin is an arid desert region on the border with Mexico and <br>
            centered on the frontier towns of Armadillo and Tumbleweed, also featured in the original game. Parts of <br>
            New Austin and West Elizabeth have been redesigned to reflect the earlier time; for example, Blackwater is <br>
            still under development, while Armadillo is a ghost town as a result of a cholera outbreak. <br>
